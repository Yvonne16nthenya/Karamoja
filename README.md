KARAMOJA PROJECT
Business Problem
The Karamoja region in northeastern Uganda consists of eight districts: Kotido, Kaabong, Karenga, Nabilatuk, Abim, Moroto, Napak, Amudat, and Nakapiripirit. Despite its agricultural potential, the region faces severe food insecurity, making it one of the most vulnerable areas in the country.

Karamoja’s districts record some of the highest Human Poverty Indices (HPI) in Uganda. Poverty levels continue to rise, with poor and inconsistent harvests being a major contributing factor. Addressing this issue requires a data-driven approach to understand crop production trends and develop strategies for improving agricultural output and food security.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
An interactive visualization has been developed to help stakeholders monitor the region’s food situation. This tool enables data-driven decision-making, allowing authorities to implement targeted interventions to combat food insecurity effectively.

OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
Identify the most productive food crop in the region. Determine which high-density population areas require increased agricultural focus. Establish the district with the highest crop yield. Analyze the relationship between crop area and yield to understand production efficiency.
